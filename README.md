Overview of the Project:
Project : PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

Objective:
The objective of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. The project aims to:

1)Split the data into training and testing sets.
2)Train the model on the training data.
3)Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
4)Make predictions on the test set.
5)Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

Key Activities:
1. Data Collection and Preparation
Activity: Acquire a dataset with continuous target variables and prepare it for analysis.

Subtasks:

Select a dataset suitable for linear regression.
Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
Inspect the dataset for initial understanding.

2. Data Exploration
Activity: Explore the data to understand its characteristics and prepare it for modeling.

Subtasks:

Examine the distribution of features and target variables.
Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable.

3. Data Splitting
Activity: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Subtasks:

Define the feature(s) and target variable.
Use the train_test_split function to divide the data.
